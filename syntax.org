* Types
** reaction_frozen

A reaction with fixed geometries. The geometries for reactants and
products and all the associated coefficients are indicated. Requires:
"type", "ref", and at least one molc entry. The units of ref are
kcal/mol, and it corresponds to the energy of each component molecule
multiplied by their respective coefficients.

** intermol_geometry

Intermolecular geometries. A dimer (mol) and its two component
monomers (mon1 and mon2) are required. The units of ref are angstrom,
and they correspond to the distance between the centers of mass of the
two monomers. The reported values are angstrom.

** intramol_geometry

Intramolecular geometries. A molecule (mol) is required, and no ref is
necessary. The relaxed geometry is compared to the reference in the db
file by means of the Kabsch algorithm. The RMS deviation is reported
in thousandths of an angstrom.

** total_energy

Total energy calculation. A molecule (mol) is required. The ref is the
reference energy for that molecule, in Hartree. The energy in Hartrees
is reported. 

** dipole

A dipole calculation. A molecule (mol) is required. The ref is the
dipole in Debye. The dipole in Debye is reported.
